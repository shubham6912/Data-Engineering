LONGTEXT understand its usecase with respect to rows

**Add constraint  see how it will affect the existing data using alter

*** Foreign Key Different use cases with and without its presense

No diff between count(*) and count(1) in terms of performance , it will just put a marker as * or as 1

select * is not often recommened , use specific columns 

** Order by two columns

<> and != are not equal operators


**** Group by is backbone of reporting

We can print only those column in select where group by is applied and rest of columns we can do aggregation

** NUll in group by  check that use case

How do you use where clause with group by , (checking null)

Group with having clause 

-- group_concat works with String , order by with group_concat and seperator
