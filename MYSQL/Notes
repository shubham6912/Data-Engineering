if not exists while creating a table

show create table <tableName>

check constaint on the table

In default constraint also null is considered as a value and will not pick default

We can give a name to our constarint name

### Do experiment with Foreign key ? Presense or not (Multiple Key)

Financial Related Oracle will be there

Real time app will be Postgress and mysql

In company cost is the main thing

Snowflake is widely used but Hive is currently HOT

1 TB of CSV cannot be used in MYSQL for dump better use nosql


Apart from this docker and flink 

Hacker rank -> for practise

https://datalemur.com/questions/uncategorized-calls-percentage

Leet code for easy and medium

Docker + Wareshousing + Schema concept + Nosql + kafka

LONGTEXT understand its usecase with respect to rows

**Add constraint  see how it will affect the existing data using alter

*** Foreign Key Different use cases with and without its presense and its corelation with index


No diff between count(*) and count(1) in terms of performance , it will just put a marker as * or as 1

select * is not often recommened , use specific columns 

** Order by two columns

<> and != are not equal operators


**** Group by is backbone of reporting

We can print only those column in select where group by is applied and rest of columns we can do aggregation

** NUll in group by  check that use case

How do you use where clause with group by , (checking null)

Group with having clause 

-- group_concat works with String , order by with group_concat and seperator


CASE WHEN STATEMENT 2:43

.* for selecting all columns

****Understand how mysql will execute multiple joins with where and group and having and order clause

****Multiple means more than 3 tables (Flow goes from top to bottom)

Update command can be used with Join 

using match in left join


COMMIT and rollback ; log file also explore

Primay key will be indexed by default

Self join example we can say is Keka Hierachial Team structure

Group with rollup

coalesce

join with group by try examples

on delete cascade

left join is hot for analytics


use rollback while writing stored procedure

update can be rollback

join ordering is imp (depicting the output) and transferring the data from one join to another


Rank , row number and dense rank ask what will happen in case of tie

Just think UPSE and IIT how they do the ranking

Top rank from each dept , top two ranks etc

Multiple group by level

firstValue , lastValue , lag and lead

following , preceeding and 3 other types

RANGE BETWEEN

weekkly sum means consider the date which is lying within the week

With clause

Recursive CTE

Hierarchy query apart from self join with recursive

ALL, ANY , EXISTS  , NOT EXISTS
